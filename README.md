Kobuki Driver
=============

[[Identify a Version](#identify-a-version)][[Flash the Firmware](#flash-the-firmware)]

This package provides the firmware blobs for a Kobuki.

**It is not a necessary dependency for the Kobuki runtime.**

## Identify a Version

Aside from the version numbers, there are three descriptive identifiers that can help you find the version you need.

* latest: most recent, but be aware that this version hasn't been tested much
* stable: more recent than factory and reasonably well tested
* factory: flashed onto the robots at the factory, has undergone stress testing
